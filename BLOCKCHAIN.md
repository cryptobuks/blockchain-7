# What is Blockchain?

### Blockchain enables peer to peer transfare of digital assets without any intermediariers.

### Establishing Trust among unknow peers

### Recording transactions on immutable distributed ladger

### Blockchain by itself has taken a life of it's own and permeated a broad range of applications accross many industries (Finance, Healtcare, goverment, manufacturing, distribution)

<h4>Examples: </h4>
<ul>
 <li>Goods Transfer - Supply Chain</li>
 <li>Digital Media Transfer - Sale of Art</li>
 <li>Remote Service Delivery - Travel and Tourisam</li>
 <li>Decentralized Business Logic - Move Computing to Data Source</li>
 <li>Distributed Intelligence - Educatinal Credentialing</li>
 <li>Distributed Resources - Power Generation and Distribution</li>
 <li>Crowd Funding - Startup Fund Raising</li>
 <li>Crowd Operation - Electronic Voting</li>
 <li>Identity Managment - One ID for all your life's functions</li>
 <li>Goverment Public Records - Open Governing</li>
 </ul>

 <h4>Establishing Trust</h4>
 <ol>
 <li>Validtion</li>
 <li>Verification</li>
 <li>Consensus</li>
 <li>Immutabel Recording</li>
 </ol>

# Blockchain Structure

### Transaction is the basic element of the Bitcoin Blockchain

### Transactions are validate and broadcast

### Many Transactions form a BLOCK.

### Many Blocks form a chain through a digital data link

### Blocks go trough a consensus process to select a next block that will be added to the chain

### Choosen Block is varify and add to the current chain

### Validation and consensus process are carried out by the blockchain protocol

<h2>UTXO - Unspent Transaction Output</h2>
<h4>The set of all UTXO in a bitcoin network collectively defined the state of the Bitcoin Blockchain</h4>
<h5>UTXO's are referenced as inputs in a transactions</h5>
<h5>UTXO's those are also outputs generated by transaction</h5>
<h5>ALL UTXO's in the system are stored by the participant nodes in a database</h5>

<h3>UTXO Structure</h3>
<ul>
<li>Unique identifier of the transaction that created the UTXO</li>
<li>Index of the UTXO in the transaction's output list</li>
<li>Optinal: conditions under which output can be spent</li>
</ul>

<h3>Transactions(TX)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Reference number of the current transaction</li>
<li>Reference(s) to one or more input UTXO's</li>
<li>Reference(s) to one or more output UTXO's newly generated by the current transaction</li>
<li>Total input amount and output amount</li>
</ol>

<h4>Basic Operations</h4>
<p>Basic Operatios in the decetralize network are the responsibility of the peer participants and their respective computational nodes(example: desktop, laptop and servers)<p>

<p>Operations: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Validation of Transactions</li>
  <li>Gathering Transactions for a block</li>
  <li>Broadcasting valid transactions & blocks</li>
  <li>Chaining Blocks</li>
</ul>
