# Securing Blockchain

## Two techniques are predominantly used for securing the chain for efficient validation and verafication:

<h2>
  <ul>
     <li>Hashing</li>
     <li>Asymmetric key encryption</li>
  </ul>
</h2>

<h3> These techniques depend on several complex proven algorithms.</h3>

<p>Example: <br>
Cesar Encryption is the simplest one with alphabets of a message are shifted by a fix number, and this number is called a key</p>

<h3>Symmetric-Key Encription Issues</h3>
 <h3>
   <ul>
      <li>Easy to derive secret key from enctypted data</li>
      <li>How do you pass the key to the participant transaction?</li>
   </ul>
 </h3>
