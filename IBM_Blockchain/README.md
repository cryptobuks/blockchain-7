# What is blockchain?

## Business networks today are often inefficient because each participant in the network keeps records,or a ledger, of all transactions between all the parties that the business interacts with. This process is expensive because of duplication of effort and intermediaries adding costs for their services.

## One solution to this problem is blockchain, which provides a shared ledger technology that allows any participant in the network to see the one system of record, or ledger. By using blockchain technology, businesses can benefit from a more efficient transfer of goods and services.

## The video modules in this course describe business networks and transactions, the problems that blockchain can solve, what blockchain is and how it works, and key use cases.
