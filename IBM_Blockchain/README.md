# What is blockchain?

## Business networks today are often inefficient because each participant in the network keeps records,or a ledger, of all transactions between all the parties that the business interacts with. This process is expensive because of duplication of effort and intermediaries adding costs for their services.

## One solution to this problem is blockchain, which provides a shared ledger technology that allows any participant in the network to see the one system of record, or ledger. By using blockchain technology, businesses can benefit from a more efficient transfer of goods and services.

## The video modules in this course describe business networks and transactions, the problems that blockchain can solve, what blockchain is and how it works, and key use cases.

## The three essential differences between Bitcoin and blockchain for business

#### A business network gets to choose who validates a transaction.

#### Assets are more diverse and important in a business network.

#### Business networks prioritize identity over anonymity.

## Core requirement for a business blockchain

#### Shared ledger, smart contract, privacy and trust

## Ledger descriotion

#### The system of record for a business

## In a cryptocurrency network like Bitcoin, you can decide who gets to validates a transaction. // False

## Selected members of a business network validate that a specific transaction occurs, which leads to trust. // True

## In a blockchain business network, every participant has a separate copy of the ledger and updates it for their transactions. // False

# Apply blockchain to business

# Blockchain for business has several advantages:

# Saves time

# Reduces cost

# Reduces risk

# Increases trust

#### For example, for financial services network, a business network that runs on a blockchain can speed up transaction processes and audits. That in turn reduces costs and can lead to greater customer satisfaction. A business that runs a supply chain network can benefit from blockchain by reducing errors in shipments, have better tracking or materials, and reduce the risk of illicit tampering of records.

# The primary benefit of immutability is Tamper-proof.
